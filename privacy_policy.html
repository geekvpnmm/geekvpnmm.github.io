        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: 22/07/2024</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.geekvpn.client" class="appname">Geek VPN</a> ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our VPN service ("Service"). By using our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>Usage Data</h3>
        <p>We collect limited information necessary for the operation of our Service, including:</p>
        <ul>

          <li><p><strong>Connection Data: </strong>Server locations you connect to, the duration of your sessions, and the amount of data transferred.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>No Personal Information Collected</h3>
        <p>We do not collect any personal information such as email, username, or phone number because our app does not have a user account registration feature yet. We will update this policy and inform you if we implement this kind of feature in the future.</p>

        <h3>Non-Logging Policy</h3>
        <p>We do not log any of your traffic data, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><strong>Browsing History: </strong>Websites you visit.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>DNS Queries: </strong>Sites you access via DNS queries.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Connection Logs: </strong>IP addresses or timestamps.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Use of Information</h2>
        <p>We use the collected information for various purposes, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To provide and maintain our Service.</li>
          <li>To notify you about changes to our Service.</li>
          <li>To provide customer support.</li>
          <li>To monitor the usage of our Service.</li>
          <li>To detect, prevent, and address technical issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties. However, we may disclose your information in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>

          <li><p><strong>Protection of Rights: </strong>To protect the rights, property, or safety of our users or the public.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your information. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, provide the Service on our behalf, perform Service-related services, or assist us in analyzing how our Service is used. These third parties have access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Geek VPN is not used to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.</p>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. We encourage all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Geek VPN app. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Geek VPN app without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to us through the Geek VPN app, please contact us (geekpanjust@gmail.com) so that we will be able to take the necessary actions. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).</p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>
        <p>This privacy policy is effective as of 22/07/2024</p>

        <h2>Your Consent</h2>
        <p>By using the Geek VPN app, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us.</p>
